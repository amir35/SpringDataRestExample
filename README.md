# SpringDataRestExample

Here we don't need to write Controller class for GET, POST, PUT etc.

Spring Data Rest will provide these operations by default.

We have to use the Spring Data started data rest maven repository.

After that we can use

http://localhost:9000

and then for any operation we can use

GET:  http://localhost:9000/consumerEntities
      http://localhost:9000/consumerEntities/21
      
POST: http://localhost:9000/consumerEntities along with Object in the body
